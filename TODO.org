#+TITLE: Helium Project TODO


* Current Experiment Running
** VM1 running 9999 preprocessing, timeout 30m, record success to result.txt, from z to a
** VM2 running 99999 preprocessing, timeout 1h
** VM3 running 9999 preprocessing, timeout 30m, record success to result.txt
** TODO record the time and error for each benchmark


* TODO [#A] For PLDI
** TODO [#A] infinite loop
** TODO [#A] NULL dereference
** TODO more buffer-overflow
** TODO grammar patching implementation and evaluation
** TODO input code into function
** TODO build rate use random selection of AST nodes or failure point
** TODO timeout limit everywhere
** SIR
** ffmpeg
** putty
* STARTED [#A] Loop bugs
  SCHEDULED: <2016-10-20 Thu>
* TODO remove duplicated TYPE snippet, but not variable

* TODO add option to control helium_dump_compile_error

* TODO extract generated init code into functions, to avoid i,ii,iii problems.
* TODO The heap size recorder
  can only work for the variables that I generate input code for.
  - it does not take into account other variables, which might be used
    as output variable
  - It does not count for the advancing of pointers. For example, the
    pointer might be advanced one, then the new pointer address is no
    longer been recorded in the heap recorder. Maybe we should try to
    keep a status variable for each variable, and update it through
    the generated code, just like what Daikon did.
* TODO confidence of inferred information
  in terms of the paper writing, we might use a confidence for the
  inference (transfer function), to remove those that have few test
  values, or those always with the same value (few distinct
  values). Daikon used a probabilistic theory to reject NULL hypothesis.
* TODO compare static
  In paper writing, don't forget to conduct a detailed comparison to
  static inferencing.
* TODO Run tests in parrel
  SCHEDULED: <2016-10-23 Sun>
* TODO transfer function with successfully runs
* TODO failure condition generation
* TODO sample program for other type of bugs
* TODO all type input generation, e.g. struct
