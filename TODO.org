#+TITLE: Helium Project TODO


* Current Experiment Running
** helium1 running new build rate testing on 515 projects, with:
- correct segment LOC
- correct removing of compile error and continue
** TODO Pick some high buildrate projects, remove segment per poi limit, and see low large the context can be.
** TODO [#A] infinite loop
** VM2 running 99999 preprocessing, timeout 1h
** gnu parallel
** From the 515 projects, run on randomly selected nodes. Each run for 100 segments. Record everything
The parameter setting:
helium
--run-test=false
--segment-per-poi-limit=100
--valid-poi-limit=100
** DONE Make the paper example working
   CLOSED: [2016-11-13 Sun 01:38]
** All three buffer overflow benchmark
** Merge if transfer is the same
** Pairwise testing, for struct!
** DONE Testing parallel
   CLOSED: [2016-11-13 Sun 01:37]
** Testing timeout explicit record
** DONE If [else]
   CLOSED: [2016-11-12 Sat 16:30]
** CANCELED [optional] From the 515 projects, run on randomly selected a set of *leaf* selection (within same function). Build them.
   CLOSED: [2016-11-10 Thu 12:44]
** DONE VM1 running 9999 preprocessing, timeout 30m, record success to result.txt, from z to a

** DONE VM3 running 9999 preprocessing, timeout 30m, record success to result.txt
   CLOSED: [2016-11-09 Wed 23:36]
** DONE record the time and error for each benchmark
   CLOSED: [2016-11-09 Wed 23:36]
** DONE Generate POI that is randomly selected

** TODO grammar patching implementation and evaluation
** TODO input code into function
** TODO build rate use random selection of AST nodes or failure point
** TODO timeout limit everywhere
** SIR
** ffmpeg
** putty
* STARTED [#A] Loop bugs
  SCHEDULED: <2016-10-20 Thu>
* TODO remove duplicated TYPE snippet, but not variable

* TODO add option to control helium_dump_compile_error

* TODO extract generated init code into functions, to avoid i,ii,iii problems.
* TODO The heap size recorder
  can only work for the variables that I generate input code for.
  - it does not take into account other variables, which might be used
    as output variable
  - It does not count for the advancing of pointers. For example, the
    pointer might be advanced one, then the new pointer address is no
    longer been recorded in the heap recorder. Maybe we should try to
    keep a status variable for each variable, and update it through
    the generated code, just like what Daikon did.
* TODO confidence of inferred information
  in terms of the paper writing, we might use a confidence for the
  inference (transfer function), to remove those that have few test
  values, or those always with the same value (few distinct
  values). Daikon used a probabilistic theory to reject NULL hypothesis.
* TODO compare static
  In paper writing, don't forget to conduct a detailed comparison to
  static inferencing.
* TODO Run tests in parrel
  SCHEDULED: <2016-10-23 Sun>
* TODO transfer function with successfully runs
