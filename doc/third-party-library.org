#+TITLE: Design Document for Third-party library

Helium relies on ~headers.conf~ for the headers to include.
Helium will test if the system has that header.
If yes, helium will include that header file in ~support.h~, and use the optional flags in ~Makefile~.

So, when you run Helium, be sure to check if you have installed that package.
If you doesn't install that, Helium will ignore the config even if you put that in ~headers.conf~.

To install all the dependencies in this file, use this command:

#+begin_src shell
   cat headers.conf  | grep devel | sed -e "s/# //" | awk '{print "sudo yum -y install" ,$0}' | bash
#+end_src

After installing every library, you may need to ~make systype.tags~ so that the index file knows all the system types you just installed..
