- I'll have another visitor called GrammarPatcher that, well this is
  tricky, goes from bottom to top of AST.
  - The input is the selection.
  - It can get the levels using the level-visitor.
  - Starting from the lowest level, get the parent, get its children
    in selection, and visit the parent node (not considering lazy
    evaluation for now). Put the parent into selection, and continue.

- Another visitor, ParentIndexer, that creates parent and sibling relationship among nodes.
