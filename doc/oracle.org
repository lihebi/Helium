* Backend Type Design
** Analyze type
   Buffer overflow:
   - strlen v.s. buffer size

   2-f:
   - pointer address in free-d list

   Null-deref:
   - Pointer is NULL, use correct runs to identify the pointer

   Infinite-loop:
   - pre-condition only
   - invariant not satisfy jumpout condition

   Let's check pre-condition along:
   - Have a reasonable invariant
   - pre-condition relate to only input variables
                   - TODO ensure the pre-condition is not satisfied by invalid tests. I.e. the pre-condition is sure to trigger!
