#+TITLE: Helium Pre-process

* Why we need pre-process
- SrcML doesn't do preprocess
- Conditional compilation often contains unbalanced parenthesis, hard for srcML.
- macros is so flexible, e.g. declare macro to define a variable.

* How to use pre-processor?
** TODO how clang implement pre-processor?

To use a pre-processor, the only thing needs to be considered is
- where to find the header files?
  - system include path
  - linux headers
  - local headers:
    - It is typically specified in Makefile for all the source files to used
    - or maybe it is specified in a concrete command for a single source file
    - So the solution: include all the folders!
- generate header files
  - autoconf will generate config.h based on current machine, we can do that
  - cmake will try to find packages and their headers. TODO
