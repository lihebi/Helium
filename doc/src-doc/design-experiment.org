#+TITLE: Experiment Design Document

This document talks about the up-coming experiment for the Framework.

Now we have multi-bug-type support:
- buffer overflow
- access violation
- null pointer dereference
- infinite loop
- double free
- free after use

- First, finish the fully automatic oracle.
- get some easy to work benchmark, preferably with apache benchmark
- run and analysis!

Also we implemented the simplification approach, test it to see if the symbolic input generation works for the POI triggering problem.
It should work!
