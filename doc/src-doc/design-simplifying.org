TODOs about the simplification of code

- Whenever the POI is hard to trigger, enter this approach.

So the hard to trigger problem should be two categories:
1. program crashes before POI
2. condition cannot be satisfied.

We take care of the second problem here, for now!

- We examine the first condition.
- Generate input space to trigger the POI


* Implementation details
- Whenever we encounter a coverage problem (the POI reach rate lower than a threshold), examine if the latest context is a branch, loop condition. If yes, continue;
- use symbolic execution to determine the input space to trigger that condition
- construct two contexts, with and without
  - needs to move the statement out of that branch
- test the pre-condition for failure runs
- If they matches, remove that branch safely
