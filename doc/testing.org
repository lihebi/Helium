#+TITLE: Testing Design document

Oh, by the way, I want to do research independent because:
- I can write down document the way I like, in the format I want, place them at the place I prefer.
- I can do really fast forward and change document accordingly.
- After I feel everything is ready, I can gather all the documents and write a paper.

I have plenty of time to follow this.

The testing part has:
- random testing, basically give the number
- pairwise testing: given the pool of possible inputs for the variables (types), there will be a fixed number of tests
- equivalent partition?
- symbolic execution?


Stack:
- make the random testing goes through every step: coverage, testing results
- implement pairwise
- research into equivalent partition

- 342 homework 5
- 572 lab 2

- write up the risks!

Today's work done!
