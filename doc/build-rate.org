#+TITLE: Build Rate

Reasons for build rate:
- the github project may have submodules that need to be get. In other
  word the project is not complete.  
  - E.g. nginx-gridfs-master, the definition for NGX_ERROR is missing,
    and it is used extensively in the code. Selecting it will gurantee
    compile failure. The missed definition:
    - ngx_str_t
    - NGX_ERROR


- Some project defines same function multiple times. E.g.
  - no-more-secrets, defines two nmstermio_refresh
