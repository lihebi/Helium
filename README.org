#+TITLE: Helium Framework

Helium is a framework to generate partial programs and run dynamic
analysis. It features a syntactic patching algorithm that find the
extra code in addition to the user selection that is necessary for a
valid partial program. It also features a demand-driven context search
algorithm to find smaller partial programs that preserve a given
program property. Please find our paper for technical details.  You
can find more detail about the code at the
[[https://helium.lihebi.com][online manual]].
