#+TITLE: TODO List for Helium Implementation

- some syntac adjustment
 - switch last stmt break;
 - else if {}

* The AST Experiment TODO

I need to plot leafsize -

Read zhendong su's paper.


* Detailed steps to plot the data
I need to plot the data by: the size and their build rate.
Essentially I need to produce a data file like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
leafsize, snippet_size, build_or_not
12, 34, true
15, 76, false
#+END_EXAMPLE

To integrate the slice, I need to:

** TODO for each of the benchmarks I want to use, randomly select some statements, and do slice
*** TODO compile the benchmark using csurf
- if makefile presents, issue =make=
- if configure presents, issue =./configure=, then =make=
- if configure.ac presents, issue =autoconf=, =./configure=, then =make=
- otherwise, who knows how to compile
** TODO process slice: separate them into pieces, remove duplication by =sort= and =uniq=
** TODO In AST initial nodes selection part, instead of =RandLeaf=, use the slice. In detail:
*** TODO for each slice criteria, locate the function, create AST
*** TODO select ASTNodes that corresponds to the lines in slice
*** TODO use builder to build the selection
*** TODO collect metrics, see if compile or not

** TODO Plot the data
*** TODO select a step, e.g. 4
*** TODO every 4 interval in the size metrics, calculate the buildrate
*** TODO for each leafsize value, compute the buildrate
*** TODO plot the leafsize-buildrate graph

* Some changes needs to be made
- =RandLeaf= may need to be replaced by =RandNode=
