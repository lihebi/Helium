#+TITLE: Machine Learning for Slicing

The data is the slice criteria generated by the following procedure:

1. run =generate-slice-criteria.sh= script, for =gzip1.7=, on two size configurations:
   10 per file and 100 per file.
2. use ~csurf -nogui -l /home/hebi/github/Helium/lib/csurf/plugin /path/to/benchmark/myproj~
   to generate slicing for each criteria.
   Some limitation for the data: no output for slicing set (initial, without removing duplication) larger than 10000
3. =uniq= the result

The format:
- every slicing criteria is outputed as =slice criteria: filename:line=,
  and  is prepended by a line ~======~
- the followings are the slices of this criteria, until another ~======~ or end of file
