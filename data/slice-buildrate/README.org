#+TITLE: Slice data handling instructions

1. change the path from absolute path to relative path
   =./to-relative-path.sh slice-100-perfile=
   This assume the folder name is the benchmark name, and appear in the slice data file.
   The output will not have benchmark name, only the relative path with regard to benchmark root dir.
2. divide the slice file into separate slicing criteria.
   =./divide-slice-bundle.sh slice-100-perfile=
   This will produce the =slice-bundle/= folder,
   contains the benchmark folders and the individual slice files.
