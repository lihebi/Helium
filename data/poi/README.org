#+TITLE: Format of Point-Of-Interest file

It is a CSV file.
The header is /required/.


The header will be hard coded inside Helium:

- benchmark :: the name of benchmark.
  This should be the /exact/ name of the benchmark folder. The version is typically needed.
- file :: the /single/ file name, e.g. a.c
- linum :: the line number
- type :: the type of the selection. The value must be one of the following: /stmt/, /loop/
- bug type :: the name of bug. Optional, unused.
- comment :: optional. Record whatever you want. Be careful about the comma
